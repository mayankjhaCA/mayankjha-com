Writing a piece for recruiting firm Power to Fly's blog about
the best jobs for ex-teachers, and looking for a few case
studies to highlight.

Requirements:

Former teacher (pre-k through 12) now in other field.

Please send through responses over email; I'll follow up with
anyone if I need more detail:

A paragraph about your background--what kind of teaching career
did you have (grade, subject, how long), and what job(s) did you
transition to afterward?

How did your transition go and are you satisfied in your new job?

What skills did you develop as a teacher that served you well in
other professions?

What do you think are the strengths and the weaknesses of
teachers as they enter the non-teaching job market?

What advice would you give a teacher thinking about switching
professions?
